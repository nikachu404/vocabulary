 <h2 align="center">📋About📋</h2>
Web application is a language learning tool that allows users to easily learn new words and test their knowledge. The app is built with React, Redux, and JavaScript, and features a user-friendly interface that is fully responsive.

Users can input words and their translations into the dictionary, and then test themselves on those words through a simple game. The game randomly selects ten words from the dictionary, shuffles them, and displays each word in English with four possible translations - one correct and three incorrect. Users click on the correct translation and move on to the next word until they have completed the ten-word test.

Once the test is finished, users are directed to the results screen, which displays their score as a percentage. The app also includes several other pages, including the dictionary page, where users can view all the words in the dictionary, and the add word page, where users can add new words to the dictionary.
